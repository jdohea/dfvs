# Finding a minimum directed feedback vertex set

In the contained files are the different components I used throughout my thesis. 

These files contain all of the algorithms, experiments and analysis code used throughout my work.

Please see my final thesis for the full discussion:

Bound Algorithm To Find A Minimum Directed
Feedback Vertex Set](Thesis.pdf)
